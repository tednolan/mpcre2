This test suite assumes that mpcre2.so has been compiled and is in the
parent directory to this one, along with the mpcre2.xc file.  It also
assumes that the "mumps" command is on PATH.  No mumps "globals" are
used in testing, so no ".gld" or ".dat" file is needed.

Despite mpcre2 not being Tcl software, the test suite uses the tcltest
framework, which is assumed to be available.  (Simply loading Tcl in
most package managers should be sufficient, I believe).

There is a test for every function in the .xc file.  However for
functions that need unimplemented helper functions or glue code,
the test is just a null "success".

The tests which *are* implemented, could obviously be much extended
and improved.

To run the tests either:

	tclsh8.6 mpcre2.test

or
	make tests
