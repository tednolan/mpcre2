This test suite assumes that mpcre2.so has been compiled and is in
the parent directory to this one, along with the mpcre2.xc file.
It also assumes that the "mumps" command is on PATH.  No mumps
"globals" are used in testing, so no ".gld" or ".dat" file is 
needed.

Despite mpcre2 not being Tcl software, the test suite uses tcl
test, which is assumed to be available.  (Simply loading Tcl
in most package managers should be sufficient, I believe).
